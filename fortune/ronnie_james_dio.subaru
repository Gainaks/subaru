My hand landed on a rock, and the gnome landed on it, squashing my thumb between the rock
and the gnome. Basically, it was crushed and took the end of my thumb off. I just looked
at my hand, and the first thought that flashed into my mind was, 'How on earth am I going
to make my devil horn sign now? That's my trademark!'
